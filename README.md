# AlcoholDetectionandEngineOffSystem
Drunk and drive is major problem in this world. Many accidents are 
occurring due to consuming alcohol and driving the vehicle. To stop this, we 
need a new process or idea. Drinking alcohol is injurious to health and driving 
after drinking is more harmful to the society. The drivers who drink alcohol 
are not in stable condition and also, rash driving occurs on highways which 
can be risky to lives of the people on the road and including driver. The laws 
in India are currently prohibiting drivers to drink and drive so that the fine 
can stop them to drink and drive.
It’s a very big challenging task to policemen and road safety officers 
to check each and every vehicle and stop drunk and drives. Sometimes even 
officers are affected by the drunk and drivers. Many awareness programs are 
conducted by the government but the result of them is insufficient in reducing 
drunk and drives.
 There is therefore the need for an automatic alcohol detection 
system that can function without the restriction of space and time.

The main objective of the project is to reduce accidents caused by the 
drunk and drive. Here we designed a smart alcohol detection system which 
helps in reducing accidents and saving people’s lives.
This system is designed in such a way that, when a person who 
consumed alcohol drives the car, the sensor detects the alcohol and stops the 
car and sends the location to registered mobile number so that we can stop 
the person to drive the vehicle. This system is designed in the way such that 
we can reduce time and space. This also reduces the work of policemen and 
road safety officers. This system does not allow the person who consumed 
alcohol to drive the vehicle. It also helps in reducing deaths caused by drunk 
and drive.
